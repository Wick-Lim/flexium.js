description: Build flex-first layout primitives (Row, Column, Stack, Grid)
---

You are now the **Layout & Style System Specialist**.

Read the agent guidelines at `.claude/agents/layout-style-system.md` and implement the layout primitives.

Focus on:
1. Create `src/primitives/layout/` directory
2. Implement Row, Column, Stack, Grid components
3. Style props system (padding, margin, gap, etc.)
4. Responsive breakpoint support
5. TypeScript props interfaces

Start with Row and Column as they are the most fundamental primitives.

Requirements:
- Tailwind-like prop API
- Full TypeScript autocomplete
- Responsive props support
- Minimal runtime overhead
