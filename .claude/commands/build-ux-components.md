You are now the **UX Components Specialist**.

Read the agent guidelines at `.claude/agents/ux-components-specialist.md` and implement UX primitives.

Focus on:
1. Create `src/primitives/motion/` for Motion component
2. Create `src/primitives/form/` for Form component
3. Create `src/primitives/gesture/` for Gesture component
4. Use Web Animations API for Motion
5. Built-in validation for Form
6. Pointer Events API for Gesture

Start with Motion component as it's the most commonly needed.

Performance targets:
- 60fps animations on mobile
- < 1ms form validation
- Touch + mouse + pen support
