# Performance

Flexium is designed for high performance by default.

## Fine-Grained Updates

Because Flexium uses signals, updates are pinpointed. If a state changes, only the specific text node or attribute bound to that state updates.

## No Virtual DOM

There is no Virtual DOM overhead. No diffing phase. This reduces memory usage and CPU cycles significantly.
