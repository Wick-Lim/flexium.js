SSR EXAMPLE CREATION SUMMARY
============================

Created: SSR (Server-Side Rendering) example in examples/ssr-example/

TOTAL FILES: 13
TOTAL LINES: ~2,500

FILE BREAKDOWN:
===============

Documentation (4 files):
  - README.md (330 lines) - Main documentation explaining SSR concepts
  - QUICKSTART.md (136 lines) - Quick start guide
  - ARCHITECTURE.md (487 lines) - Deep technical dive
  - FILES.md (360 lines) - File structure overview

Configuration (4 files):
  - package.json (26 lines) - Dependencies and scripts
  - tsconfig.json (37 lines) - TypeScript configuration
  - vite.config.ts (22 lines) - Vite bundler config
  - .gitignore (23 lines) - Git ignore rules

Source Code (4 files):
  - server.ts (92 lines) - Express server with SSR support
  - src/App.tsx (182 lines) - Main application (Counter + TodoList)
  - src/entry-server.tsx (16 lines) - Server entry (renderToString)
  - src/main.tsx (20 lines) - Client entry (hydrate)

Template (1 file):
  - index.html (407 lines) - HTML template with complete styling

FEATURES DEMONSTRATED:
======================

1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
   - renderToString() to generate HTML on server
   - Express server serving SSR content
   - Development and production modes

2. Client-Side Hydration
   - hydrate() to make HTML interactive
   - Event handler attachment
   - Signal reactivity activation

3. Interactive Components
   - Counter with signal state
   - TodoList with array management
   - Computed values
   - Event handlers

4. Best Practices
   - Isomorphic code (runs on server and client)
   - XSS protection with HTML escaping
   - TypeScript types throughout
   - Comprehensive documentation

HOW TO RUN:
===========

1. From monorepo root:
   npm install
   cd examples/ssr-example
   npm run dev

2. Open http://localhost:3000

3. See server-rendered content immediately
   Then watch it become interactive after hydration

WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
================

- Counter component (increment/decrement)
- Todo list (add, complete, delete items)
- Statistics (computed values)
- Information about how SSR works
- Feature cards explaining benefits

KEY CONCEPTS EXPLAINED:
=======================

1. How SSR Works
   - Server renders to HTML string
   - Client receives fully-formed HTML
   - JavaScript loads and hydrates
   - App becomes interactive

2. Hydration Process
   - Walk existing DOM tree
   - Attach event listeners
   - Setup signal reactivity
   - No re-rendering needed

3. Signal Behavior
   - Server: values are read, no tracking
   - Client: values are reactive, auto-update

4. Benefits
   - Fast initial load
   - SEO friendly
   - Progressive enhancement
   - Fine-grained reactivity after hydration
